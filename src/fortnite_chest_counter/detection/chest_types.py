"""
Chest type from the pop-up line (v0.2.2, docs/INVESTIGATION_2026-11-08.md): "CHEST", "RARE CHEST" or "SPRITE CHEST".

Classification never creates or removes a count: it only labels a chest the counter already counted. What is read:

  * the word LEFT of the line's CHEST word. Nothing there -> a normal chest.
  * its LENGTH, relative to the CHEST word (so it works at any HUD size): RARE 0.77-0.89, SPRITE 1.04-1.18 on the
    labelled footage, nothing (normal chest) 0.00-0.04. A shorter template can match the tail of a longer word, so length
    decides and the word confirms it: the EXACT match of the length-matching word >= WORD_MIN and >= WORD_MARGIN above
    the other word (real words: 0.67-0.94 median, the other word 0.22-0.39; random ink of the same length: <= 0.41 - a
    blurred match was rejected: random ink reached 0.65 against it).
  * anything else (another word, background ink, a length in between) -> "unknown". An uncertain line is never called
    a normal chest just because RARE / SPRITE was not recognised.

The type of a counted chest is the majority of its line's per-frame readings while the pop-up stays on screen (votes),
so a type can become known after the chest was counted - that changes the label, never the count.

To add a type: cut its word as a template (prefix templates below, one per HUD size), give its length range in TYPES.
Templates: chest/en/rare*.npy and sprite*.npy, cut from the English reference clip (RARE, normal size), Replays'
stream (SPRITE, normal size) and Thiefs' stream (both, small size).
