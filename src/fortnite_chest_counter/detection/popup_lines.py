"""
Pop-up content tracking (v0.2.2, docs/reference/INVESTIGATION_2026-11-08.md): what is INSIDE the XP pop-up while it stays on screen.

Fortnite does not show a new pop-up for every chest. While a pop-up is on screen, the next chest is ADDED to it:

    +900 XP          +1,800 XP            +1,800 XP             +2,700 XP
    RARE CHEST   ->  RARE CHEST X2    or  RARE CHEST        ->  RARE CHEST
                                          SPRITE CHEST          SPRITE CHEST X2

so a counter that only reacts to a pop-up appearing misses every chest after the first. This module finds the CHEST lines
of the pop-up (every line whose word matches the chest-word template - "RARE CHEST", "SPRITE CHEST", "CHEST"; other lines
such as SPRITE LEVEL or NEW STORM PHASE score clearly lower) and the multiplier ("X2", "X3", ...) right of each word, and
reports a chest each time that content changes:

  * a chest line is added                                      (+1)
  * a multiplier appears on a line ("RARE CHEST" -> "X2")      (+1)
  * a line's multiplier digit changes ("X2" -> "X3")           (+1)

Safeguards (each from a measured failure case):
  * a state must hold for STABLE_SECONDS before it counts - lines, multipliers AND the XP number standing still: after
    every addition the XP number counts up ("+2,016" ... "+2,700") and a state caught mid-animation made a false step;
  * the pop-up's XP total ("+1,800 XP" -> "+2,700 XP") must have changed too: every chest adds XP and the number
    animates, while a lavender wall behind a line or compression noise does not touch it (measured: the XP line matches
    itself at 0.98-1.00 inside a state and drops to 0.32-0.43 at every real addition);
  * the first state of a pop-up never counts by itself - the pop-up's onset already counted one chest, and "X3" seen
    first does not prove three chests were opened while we watched;
  * at most one chest per change, and none within SETTLE_SECONDS of the previous one: opening a chest takes about a
    second (the onset detector's 1 s rule), while the multiplier and XP number keep animating for a moment after a change -
    meanwhile the reference follows the settled content silently (a reference caught mid-animation made a false step);
  * lines and multipliers never go away while a pop-up lives (they all fade together at the end), so a state with
    fewer lines or a lost multiplier is never adopted: a line flickering under the threshold would otherwise come back
    as a "new" line (seen on the reference clip's RARE CHEST line at 0.74-0.77);
  * a digit change must keep the line's strength and ink (a fading pop-up erodes the digit);
  * lines are matched by order from the top: a line added below pushes the others up, which is not a change.

Each frame also reads every chest line's TYPE (chest_types.py, via the `classify` hook) as a vote per line, so the
estimator can label each counted chest with the line that produced it - a label only, never a count.

No OCR: the digit is compared with the line's previous digit only, so X4..X9 need no templates. Pure numpy on the
lavender mask the detector computes anyway; it only runs while a pop-up is being tracked.
