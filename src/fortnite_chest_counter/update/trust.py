"""
The Ed25519 public keys this copy of the app trusts to sign updates: raw 32-byte keys, as hex. See docs/maintenance/UPDATE_SIGNING.md.

Public keys are not secret. The matching private keys never enter this repository or a release.

An update must carry a valid signature from one of these keys. This list changes only by installing a release that a key already
listed has signed: nothing in a release, a setting or a file can add to it.
