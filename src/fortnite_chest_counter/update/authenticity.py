"""
Is this release really ours? Every release the updater may install carries two small files next to the zip:

    update-manifest.json       exactly what was released, as canonical JSON on one line:
        {"format":1,"product":"fortnite-visual-chest-counter","sha256":"<hex>","size":123,"version":"0.2.3","zip":"<name>"}
    update-manifest.json.sig   one or more Ed25519 signatures of those exact bytes:
        {"format":1,"signatures":[{"key_id":"<16 hex>","signature":"<base64>"}]}

The signature is checked on the raw bytes BEFORE the manifest is read at all. There is no unsigned path: a missing, damaged
or unknown signature means no update. Several signatures are allowed so a release can be signed by an old and a new key
while keys are being changed (docs/maintenance/UPDATE_SIGNING.md).

Trust comes only from trust.py in the INSTALLED app. Nothing a release carries can add a key: a key id only selects among
the keys already installed, and the key bytes that do the verifying always come from that list.

The manifest binds the version to one exact zip. Its name, size and SHA-256 must then match what GitHub lists, and later the
downloaded file. A properly signed old manifest attached to a new tag fails, and so does anything not newer than this copy.
