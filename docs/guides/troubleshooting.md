# Troubleshooting

First step for anything unclear: in the app open **Help & diagnostics** -> **Run diagnostics** -> **Copy report** (also
saved to `logs\diagnostics.txt`). Include it, and any `logs\crash_*.txt`, when you
[open an issue](https://github.com/GabrielGzS/fortnite-visual-chest-counter/issues).

## The counter does not get a picture

| Message or symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `OBS Virtual Camera was not found` | Open OBS Studio 28+, click **Start Virtual Camera**, then **Start counting** again. |
| `exists but is not sending video` | Click **Start Virtual Camera** again; check that `ChestDetectorFeed` is not black. |
| Live preview black or showing the wrong scene | Virtual Camera settings (gear): **Output Type** = **Scene**, **Output Selection** = **ChestDetectorFeed**. With Studio Mode, make sure the scene holding your gameplay source is live in **Program**. |
| Virtual Camera already used by something else | Use an **OBS projector window** of your gameplay source ([guide](obs-projector.md)), or the capture card directly ([capture-card guide](capture-card.md#advanced-the-capture-card-directly-without-obs)). |
| `The OBS projector window you picked is not open` | In OBS right-click the gameplay source > **Windowed Projector (Source)**, then **Refresh** and pick it. Tip: OBS > Settings > General > Projectors > **Save projectors on exit**. |
| `projector window is minimized` / black preview | Restore the projector window. It may be behind other windows, but not minimized. |
| `the projector window was closed, so counting stopped` | Reopen it in OBS and press **Start counting**. |
| `Could not open the video device` | The card is probably in use by OBS: close OBS or remove the card from it - or use the Virtual Camera or a projector. |
| Status says **No video** | The app has had no new pictures from this source for 10 seconds, so chests cannot be counted. Check that the source is still sending video. Counting carries on by itself when pictures return, and says that some footage may be missing. Counts are kept. |
| `already running` / `already open` | Only one counter runs at a time; use the open one (taskbar). |
| `Could not open the livestream` | The stream must be live and public. Use the full link (`https://www.twitch.tv/CHANNEL`, a YouTube `watch?v=` link or `https://www.youtube.com/@CHANNEL/live`). |
| Livestream: *buffering* / *reconnecting* | Slow connection, an ad break or the stream restarted. The counter waits and continues by itself; counts are kept. |

## The picture is there, but counting looks wrong

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Number never changes | Dashboard, **Game** view, turn on **Live preview**: 16:9, full picture, HUD visible? Does the chest pop-up ("CHEST" / "BAÚ") appear in `ChestDetectorFeed`? Is **Settings -> Fortnite language** right for your game? |
| Many chests only in APPROX | Normal for compressed or larger-HUD video. Better picture quality (higher bitrate, clean feed) helps; APPROX is the estimated total. |
| Missed or wrong chests | Fix the number with **+1** / **−1** next to the counts. To help improve the counter: Dashboard, **Console** view -> **Diagnostic recording** -> "Only around my marks", then press **Ctrl+Alt+M** right after each miss. Share that session's `captures\` folder in an issue ([details](../CAPTURE.md)). |
| Count should start from an earlier number | Dashboard -> **Edit counts...**: APPROX = the chests already opened, CERTAIN = 0. **Reset...** sets both to 0. Both work while counting. |

## The number on stream is wrong or not updating

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| OBS text blank or not updating | The Text source must have **Read from file** ticked and point at the file shown on the app's **Overlay** page. |
| Text shows something different from the app | That Text source reads another file (for example an old copy of the app). Re-point it ([overlay guide](obs-overlay.md)). |
| OBS WebSocket: *Waiting for OBS* | OBS is closed, or **Tools > WebSocket Server Settings > Enable WebSocket server** is off, or the port differs (default 4455). |
| OBS WebSocket: *Password problem* | Copy the password again from OBS (**Show Connect Info**), paste it on the Overlay page, click **Connect**. |
| OBS WebSocket: *the source reads a file* | That Text source has **Read from file** ticked, so OBS ignores direct updates: click **Use direct updates**, or pick another source. |
| OBS WebSocket: text flickers between two values | Another tool also updates that Text source. Give each tool its own source. |
| Numbers wrong after moving the app to a new folder | Copy `state\` and `config.toml` from the old folder and re-point the OBS Text source. |

## Match tracking and Analytics

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Analytics says *No matches recorded yet* | Check **Settings > Match tracking (experimental)** is ticked, then **Start counting** and play a match. A match appears after it ends. |
| Game view stays on *Not sure yet* | Match tracking reads English screens only. Check that the picture is 16:9 with the menus and HUD visible (**Live preview**, same view). Your chests are still counted. |
| A match is **Partial** | Its start or its end was not seen: you started counting after it began, stopped before the end, or the video dropped. This is expected, and its time still shows. |
| CERTAIN stays at 0 while APPROX climbs | Expected on a small HUD: those pop-ups only ever count as APPROX. APPROX is the best estimate and already includes CERTAIN. |
| Analytics says *Not enough complete matches* | The main chests per minute needs five minutes of active play in complete matches. **Including partial matches** shows the wider figure meanwhile. |
| Game shows a dash | No match is open yet, or the app is not yet sure it is a match. Chests per minute need a minute of play. Your Overview totals keep counting. |
| A recorded match was not a real match | Analytics -> **Not a match**. **Restore** puts it back. |
| Analytics total differs from the Dashboard | Expected. Analytics only covers chests recorded with match tracking on, and leaves out **+1** / **−1** and **Edit counts...**. The Dashboard stays the official total. |

## Still stuck

Give the [README](../../README.md) and the guide for your setup to an AI assistant and ask it to walk you through it one
step at a time - the README's "Getting setup help from AI" section lists the facts it needs. Or open an issue with the
diagnostics report.
