"""
Real-world detection cases (tests/cases/cases.json, docs/INVESTIGATION_2026-11-08.md) as permanent regression tests.

Each case's pop-up box masks (tests/fixtures/popups/<case>.npz, made by research/cases.py fixtures from the user's
diagnostic captures) are replayed through the real ChestEstimator. The pop-up channels work on that mask only, so the
pop-up decisions are the ones the full footage gives (research/cases.py run checks the full frames when the footage is
present). The other clues (prompt, sprite tag, ammo) see an empty picture here.

Every confirmed failure becomes a case: add it to cases.json, run `research/cases.py fetch` + `fixtures`, add a check.
Run:   python tests/test_cases.py     (or pytest)
